# MyGannGo

MyGannGo implements a bunch of **modular** code that can be used to interact with MyGann (Gann Academy's _amazing_ learning managment system) through code. To use it, just install the requirements that are in the package.json, copy the config_template.js and name it config.js, and add your Gann email and password. 

It utilizes a proxy server for API requests and puppeteerjs to get cookies automatically. There are configs on every function to add a bit of customization. 

It now supports getting assignments from the assignment center as well as navigating through a (hopefully) intuitive API. If you want, you can add more nav places, open  a pull request, and you can help!
